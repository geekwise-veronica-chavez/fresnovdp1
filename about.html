                    The Fresno Veterans Day Parade honors our veterans from all branches. The parade is held in downtown Fresno. It has grown by leaps and bounds over its nine decades of existence, so much so in fact, that in 2007, the Executive Board of the Parade presented the idea of becoming incorporated and applying for 501(c)3 status. The response was unanimous and the parade became a not-for-profit corporation in California.</article>

                    Wikipedia – U.S. President Woodrow Wilson first proclaimed Armistice Day for November 11, 1919. In proclaiming the holiday, he said "To us in America, the reflections of Armistice Day will be filled with solemn pride in the heroism of those who died in the country's service and with gratitude for the victory, both because of the thing from which it has freed us and because of the opportunity it has given America to show her sympathy with peace and justice in the councils of the nations."

                <article>The United States Congress passed a           concurrent resolution seven years later on June     4, 1926, requesting that President Calvin           Coolidge issue another proclamation to observe     November 11 with appropriate ceremonies. A         Congressional Act (52 Stat. 351; 5 U.S. Code,       Sec. 87a) approved May 13, 1938, made the 11th     of November in each year a legal holiday: "a       day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace     and to be thereafter celebrated and known as       'Armistice Day'.

                <article>In 1945, WWII veteran Raymond Weeks from       Birmingham, Alabama had the idea to expand         Armistice Day to celebrate all veterans, not       just those who died in World War I. Weeks led a     delegation to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower, who           supported the idea of National Veterans Day.       Weeks led the first national celebration in         1947 in Alabama and annually until his death in     1985. President Reagan honored Weeks at The         White House with the Presidential Citizenship       Medal in 1982 as the driving force for the         national holiday. Elizabeth Dole, who prepared     the briefing for President Reagan, determined       Weeks as the "Father of Veterans Day."</article>
            <article>U.S. Representative Ed Rees from Emporia,             Kansas, presented a bill establishing the               holiday through Congress. President Dwight             Eisenhower, also from Kansas, signed the bill           into law on May 26, 1954. Congress amended this         act on June 1,1954, replacing "Armistice" with         "Veterans," and it has been known as Veterans            Day since.The National Veterans Award, created         in 1954, also started in Birmingham, Alabama.           Congressman Rees of Kansas was honored in               Alabama as the first recipient of the award for         his support offering legislation to make               Veterans Day a federal holiday, which marked           nine years of effort by Raymond Weeks. Weeks           conceived the idea in 1945, petitioned Gen.             Eisenhower in 1946, led the first Veterans Day         celebration in 1947 (keeping the official name         Armistice Day until Veterans Day was legal in           1954).
